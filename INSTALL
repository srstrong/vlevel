VLevel 0.3 INSTALL

VLevel is distributed as source code.  To build it, type "make".  To
install it, login as root (type "su") and type "make install".

You can change where it is installed by editing Makefile before doing
the above.

I test VLevel on a Linux system, but it should build on any similar
system.  It should compile on Windows, but it won't be very useful
until I write a Ruby script with a nice cross-platform GUI and SOX
integration.
